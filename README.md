To enable linting in your editor, you may need to install the ESLint and Prettier extensions.
There are also pre-commit hooks setup to run linting before a commit is made. You will need to fix these issues before making a commit.
You can also manually run linting with the following command:

```bash
npm run lint # show but not fix
npm run lint:fix # show and attempt to fix automatically
npm run format # fix formatting
npm run format:check # check formatting
```

### Git Hooks

This repo is setup with git hooks using [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) and [Lint-Staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged).

Any time a commit is made, all files will be linted and formatted. If there are any issues, the commit will be rejected.
